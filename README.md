# DeltaGlider üõ∏

**Store 4TB of similar files in 5GB. No, that's not a typo.**

DeltaGlider is a drop-in S3 replacement that achieves 99.9% compression for versioned artifacts, backups, and release archives through intelligent binary delta compression.

## The Problem We Solved

You're storing hundreds of versions of your releases. Each 100MB build differs by <1% from the previous version. You're paying to store 100GB of what's essentially 100MB of unique data.

Sound familiar?

## Real-World Impact

From our [ReadOnlyREST case study](docs/case-study-readonlyrest.md):
- **Before**: 201,840 files, 3.96TB storage, $1,120/year
- **After**: Same files, 4.9GB storage, $1.32/year
- **Compression**: 99.9% (not a typo)
- **Integration time**: 5 minutes

## How It Works

```
Traditional S3:
  v1.0.0.zip (100MB) ‚Üí S3: 100MB
  v1.0.1.zip (100MB) ‚Üí S3: 100MB (200MB total)
  v1.0.2.zip (100MB) ‚Üí S3: 100MB (300MB total)

With DeltaGlider:
  v1.0.0.zip (100MB) ‚Üí S3: 100MB reference + 0KB delta
  v1.0.1.zip (100MB) ‚Üí S3: 98KB delta (100.1MB total)
  v1.0.2.zip (100MB) ‚Üí S3: 97KB delta (100.3MB total)
```

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Via pip (Python 3.11+)
pip install deltaglider

# Via uv (faster)
uv pip install deltaglider

# Via Docker
docker run -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws deltaglider/deltaglider --help
```

### Your First Upload

```bash
# Upload a file - DeltaGlider automatically handles compression
deltaglider put my-app-v1.0.0.zip s3://releases/

# Upload v1.0.1 - automatically creates a 99% smaller delta
deltaglider put my-app-v1.0.1.zip s3://releases/
# ‚Üë This 100MB file takes only ~100KB in S3

# Download - automatically reconstructs from delta
deltaglider get s3://releases/my-app-v1.0.1.zip
# ‚Üë Seamless reconstruction, SHA256 verified
```

## Intelligent File Type Detection

DeltaGlider automatically detects file types and applies the optimal strategy:

| File Type | Strategy | Typical Compression |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| `.zip`, `.tar`, `.gz` | Binary delta | 99%+ for similar versions |
| `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm` | Binary delta | 95%+ for similar versions |
| `.jar`, `.war`, `.ear` | Binary delta | 90%+ for similar builds |
| `.exe`, `.dll`, `.so` | Direct upload | 0% (no delta benefit) |
| `.txt`, `.json`, `.xml` | Direct upload | 0% (use gzip instead) |
| `.sha1`, `.sha512`, `.md5` | Direct upload | 0% (already minimal) |

## Performance Benchmarks

Testing with real software releases:

```python
# 513 Elasticsearch plugin releases (82.5MB each)
Original size:       42.3 GB
DeltaGlider size:    115 MB
Compression:         99.7%
Upload speed:        3-4 files/second
Download speed:      <100ms reconstruction
```

## Integration Examples

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
- name: Upload Release with 99% compression
  run: |
    pip install deltaglider
    deltaglider put dist/*.zip s3://releases/${{ github.ref_name }}/
```

### Backup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily backup with automatic deduplication
tar -czf backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /data
deltaglider put backup-*.tar.gz s3://backups/
# Only changes are stored, not full backup
```

### Python SDK

```python
from deltaglider import DeltaService

service = DeltaService(
    bucket="releases",
    storage_backend="s3",  # or "minio", "r2", etc
)

# Upload with automatic compression
summary = service.put("my-app-v2.0.0.zip", "v2.0.0/")
print(f"Stored {summary.original_size} as {summary.stored_size}")
# Output: Stored 104857600 as 98304 (99.9% reduction)

# Download with automatic reconstruction
service.get("v2.0.0/my-app-v2.0.0.zip", "local-copy.zip")
```

## Architecture

DeltaGlider uses a clean hexagonal architecture:

## FAQ

**Q: What if my reference file gets corrupted?**
A: Every operation includes SHA256 verification. Corruption is detected immediately.

**Q: How fast is reconstruction?**
A: Sub-100ms for typical files. The delta is applied in-memory using xdelta3.

**Q: Can I use this with existing S3 data?**
A: Yes! DeltaGlider can start optimizing new uploads immediately. Old data remains accessible.

**Q: What's the overhead for unique files?**
A: Zero. Files without similarity are uploaded directly.

**Q: Is this compatible with S3 encryption?**
A: Yes, DeltaGlider respects all S3 settings including SSE, KMS, and bucket policies.

## The Math

For `N` versions of a `S` MB file with `D%` difference between versions:

**Traditional S3**: `N √ó S` MB
**DeltaGlider**: `S + (N-1) √ó S √ó D%` MB

Example: 100 versions of 100MB files with 1% difference:
- **Traditional**: 10,000 MB
- **DeltaGlider**: 199 MB
- **Savings**: 98%
